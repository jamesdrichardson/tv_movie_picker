# tv_movie_picker

The base purpose of this project is to make a CRUD app. The real purpose of this project is to help me with the decision paralysis of picking what to watch.
The basic idea is that the user can give the application specific search terms and the aplication will use those categories to then return 3 options that fit your search terms. 
I also plan to use The Movie DataBase's API to populate soe information about movies that are added to my database. 
The database started with 100 entries (75 tv shows and 25 movies) that will be used for making sure all functions work. 

As I add to the application I will add more sections here about how different methods work and what they are used for.
